Toy implementations of whatever I happen to be reading. Weights at https://huggingface.co/llllvvuu/ml_tutorials

## Example
```sh
pip install -r python/expert_iteration/requirements.txt
python -m python.expert_iteration
```

## Implemented
* [Vanilla Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)](./python/mcts/README.md)
* [Expert Iteration (ExIt)](./python/expert_iteration/README.md), from [Thinking Fast and Slow with Deep Learning and Tree Search (Anthony, Tian, Barber 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08439)
