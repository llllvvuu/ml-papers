Toy implementations of whatever papers I happen to be reading.

I try to prioritize papers where either no open-source implementations exist, or open-source implementations aren't very lean or usable.

## Example
```sh
pip install -r llllvvuu/expert_iteration/requirements.txt
python -m llllvvuu.expert_iteration
```

## Implemented
* [Vanilla Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)](./llllvvuu/mcts/README.md)
* [Expert Iteration (ExIt)](./llllvvuu/expert_iteration/README.md), from [Thinking Fast and Slow with Deep Learning and Tree Search (Anthony, Tian, Barber 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08439)
